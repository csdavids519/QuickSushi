### Wireframes
See wireframe documentation:

### Testing


### Bugs / known issues
* Menu nav bar was not able to use 'sticky' position type due to browser support, to overcome this a second nav bar is hidden behind the header and comes into view when the user scrolls down. If the user scrolls very slow, it is possible to have two menu nav bars overlapping. 




## Future improvements
 * Add a more interactive menu page.
 * Stager 'review' section review images, and animate to randomly display as the user scrolls past.
 * improve home page preformance using different file types for images.
 * Animate the user reviews section scale transition to move more slowly for improved view experience.
